    <p>
      Hi, my name is Fadejimi Aderele. I am a student at the University of
      Indianapolis studying Computer Science. I am passionate about technology,
      problem-solving, and building impactful projects. Outside of coding, youâ€™ll probably find me investigating new tech products, watching Formula One, building LEGO or playing racing games.
